1. Clone the Repository
    git clone https://github.com/1ghernandez/3550-jwks-server-project.git
2. Install the required programs
3. From your terminal/console start the server by using
    "python3 app.py" or "python app.py"
    NOTE: The python you use depends on if you have various versions of python downloaded. 
    For example, if you have python 2 and 3 downloaded then use "python3 app.py" otherwise just use "python app.py".

## Testing
To test I used pytest. 
In your terminal/console use the command "pytest" to test the test suite. 
NOTE: Ensure when you use pytest, you are in the directory in which the repository exists.
